# Masters Driving Distance Over The Years
For this project, I wanted to look at data that I have showed interest in over the years. Because I have played golf for so long, I thought looking at driving distances would be perfect. How far a player can hit a ball has been a big topic of discussion on the past year on the Tour. This is because there have been a couple players who are outdriving everyone else. Not only are they hitting the ball far, but they are winning tournaments. I wanted to look at how fast driving distances are changes over the years. 
# Process
The process that I used for gathering the data was quite simple. I got the data from https://www.pgatour.com/stats/stat.101.html. This is a great source because all data is coming directly from the tournaments. I sorted the data by the Tournament Only option that they have on the site, and only took a look at the top 15 players. I decided to go with only the top 15 because after that, the average really does not change much. There was not any cleaning that I had to do other than taking from the top 15.

The graph that I have provided shows the progression of the average driving distance at The Masters in the past six years.
